# Project Title: 2D to 3D Mesh Reconstruction

## Description
This project aims to reconstruct 3D meshes from 2D images using a series of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook focuses on a specific step in the process, from data analysis to postprocessing.

## Notebooks

1. **main_0_data_analysis.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook performs data analysis on the input dataset.

2. **main_1_data_plot.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook generates various plots to visualize the data.

3. **main_2_video_to_image.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook extracts frames from a video and converts them into images.

4. **main_3_remove_bg.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook removes the background from the images.

5. **main_4_deblur.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook deblurs the images to enhance their quality.

6. **main_5_2D_to_3D.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook reconstructs 3D meshes from the 2D images.

7. **main_6_volume_calculation.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook calculates the volume of the reconstructed 3D meshes.

8. **main_7_postprocessing.ipynb**
   - Initial commit
   - Added: now
   - Description: This notebook performs postprocessing on the 3D meshes to refine them.

## Output
